# This is a story for Emma:

### Chapter 1

Once upon a time, there was a teapot. its name was short and stout. He said here is my handle! But he's wife told him, get back to work, you're too skinny. We need wheat! Fat babies.

So Sas (short-and-stout for short), went on his way to make a fortune. He decided his first destination should be the weaver. The weaver had all kinds of tricks for making money (at that casino, totally unrelated to weaving).
